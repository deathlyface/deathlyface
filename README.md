# Brian

I renamed my username (deathlyface) to [brian-the-dev](https://github.com/brian-the-dev/) and my domain to [brianthe.dev](https://brianthe.dev). This account was created to prevent username takeover, possibly breaking the redirects. 

## Why?
- I did not create the name deathlyface.
- Deathlyface sounds scary, especially when it's written under my profile picture (which is a blurred face).
